    "# Week 6 - Probability distributions & meteor shower gazing\n",
    "\n",
    "Many topics in Earth Scientists require an understanding of probability. You've probably heard people ask questions along the lines of 'can we predict earthquakes'? To which the simple answer is no! We can, however, use statistics to forecast the probability of an earthquake over a certain time period. A good example of this - and very relevant to students at UC Berkeley - is this forecast for major earthquake ruptures in the bay area between 2014 and 2043 (https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/earthquake-probabilities-sf-bay-area)!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll discuss some key statistics topics (samples vs populations, empirical vs theorectical distributions), consider how the Binomial distribution can be used to simulate a coin toss and the likelihood of 'successful' well drilling, and examine the probability of witnessing a meteor shower.

    "A relatively straight-forward distribution is the _binomial_ distribution which describes the probability of a particular outcome when there are only two possibilities (yes or no, heads or tails, 1 or 0).   For example, in a coin toss experiment (heads or tails), if we flip the coin  $n$ times, what is the probability of getting $x$ 'heads'?  We assume that the probability $p$ of a head for any given coin toss is 50%; put another way $p$ = 0.5.  \n",

    "> **How big are most meteoroids? How fast do they travel?** The majority of visible meteors are caused by particles ranging in size from about that of a small pebble down to a grain of sand, and generally weigh less than 1-2 grams. Those of asteroid origin can be composed of dense stony or metallic material (the minority) while those of cometary origin (the majority) have low densities and are composed of a “fluffy” conglomerate of material, frequently called a “dustball.” The brilliant flash of light from a meteor is not caused so much by the meteoroid’s mass, but by its high level of kinetic energy as it collides with the atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Meteors enter the atmosphere at speeds ranging from 11 km/sec (25,000 mph), to 72 km/sec (160,000 mph!). When the meteoroid collides with air molecules, its high level of kinetic energy rapidly ionizes and excites a long, thin column of atmospheric atoms along the meteoroid’s path, creating a flash of light visible from the ground below. This column, or meteor trail, is usually less than 1 meter in diameter, but will be tens of kilometers long.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The wide range in meteoroid speeds is caused partly by the fact that the Earth itself is traveling at about 30 km/sec (67,000 mph) as it revolves around the sun. On the evening side, or trailing edge of the Earth, meteoroids must catch up to the earth’s atmosphere to cause a meteor, and tend to be slow. On the morning side, or leading edge of the earth, meteoroids can collide head-on with the atmosphere and tend to be fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **What is a meteor shower? Does a shower occur “all at once” or over a period of time?** Most meteor showers have their origins with comets. Each time a comet swings by the sun, it produces copious amounts of meteoroid sized particles which will eventually spread out along the entire orbit of the comet to form a meteoroid “stream.” If the Earth’s orbit and the comet’s orbit intersect at some point, then the Earth will pass through this stream for a few days at roughly the same time each year, encountering a meteor shower. The only major shower clearly shown to be non-cometary is the Geminid shower, which share an orbit with the asteroid (3200 Phaethon): one that comes unusually close to the sun as well as passing through the earth’s orbit. Most shower meteoroids appear to be “fluffy”, but the Geminids are much more durable as might be expected from asteroid fragments.\n",
